## HANDRWRITING RECOGNITION MODEL
<br>
Implementation of the deep learning algorithm Convolutional Neural Network (or CNN) to classify images of handwritten digit samples in 10 classes (0-9) using pytorch.

### DATA: MNIST dataset

<br>
The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original datasets. The creators felt that since NIST's training dataset was taken from American Census Bureau employees, while the testing dataset was taken from American high school students, it was not well-suited for machine learning experiments. Furthermore, the black and white images from NIST were normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, which introduced grayscale levels.
